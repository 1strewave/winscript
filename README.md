## Features

- Launch and control applications
- Simulate keystrokes and text input
- Mouse movement and clicks
- Simple delays (`wait`)
- Clean and readable syntax
- Command-line interface via `winscript`
- Built entirely in Go, easily extendable

---

## Example Script

```winscript
open "notepad.exe"
wait 2s
type "Hello from WinScript!"
move_mouse 400 300
click "left"
```

Scripts are saved with the `.ws` extension.

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/winscript.git
cd winscript
go build -o winscript
```

Now the `winscript` CLI is available for use.

---

## CLI

WinScript uses a Cobra-based CLI. Available commands:

```bash
winscript [file]             # Run a script
winscript run script.ws      # Explicit script run
winscript version            # Show version
winscript help               # Display help
```

### Examples

```bash
winscript hello.ws
winscript run scripts/boot.ws
winscript version
```
